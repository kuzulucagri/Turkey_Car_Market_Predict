# Turkey_Car_Market_Predict

At this project I have used popular machine learning algorithms which are **Linear Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest** algorithms for predict Turkey car market prices.

I downloaded that dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/alpertemel/turkey-car-market-2020

I have put detailed comment on every cell for explanation.

Here is the predict result with Decision Tree Algorithm which is the best model score.

Also I can show the regression's plot result.
